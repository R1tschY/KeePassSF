    text: qsTr("On this dialog you can change database internal settings of your currently opened Keepass \
database file.<br><br>\
\
<b>Master password</b><br><br>\
Here you can type in a new master password for the Keepass database. Please note that if you forgot your master \
password there is no way to recover the password. It is not saved in the Keepass database and there is also no backdoor \
to open the database without your password. Furhtermore make sure you choose a long password of around 10 - 15 \
characters and use a mixture of small and big letters, numbers and special characters. Repeat the password in the \
\"Confirm Master Password\" field.<br><br>\
\
<b>Encryption currently in use</b><br><br>\
This is the encryption algorithm which is used to cipher the Keepass database content.<br><br>\
\
<b>Key transformation rounds</b><br><br>\
\
Set the default value for key transformation rounds for your Keepass database. \
This value controls the amount of encryption rounds computed \
on the master password. Adjusting this value has direct effect on the time \
needed to decrypt the database on loading. But setting this value higher makes \
the database more robust against brute force attacks. \
As a good compromise between security and usability you should adjust the value so that opening \
the database takes one second on your phone.<br><br>")
