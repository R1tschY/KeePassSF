    text: qsTr("Here you can open an existing Keepass database file.<br><br>\
\
Use the file browser to search for your Keepass database file. You will be able to look into the \
following locations: Device Memory, SD card and Android storage. If you have trouble \
with KeePassSF not finding the file please make sure to place it in below mentioned paths. \
\"Device Memory\" is located at \"%1\". If a SD card is inserted in your phone it is located at \"/media/sdcard/&lt;UUID&gt;\". \
(Please note that SD cards with more than one partition are not supported.) \"Android storage\" \
is located at \"%2\".<br><br>\
\
Advice: If you upload your Keepass database into the cloud please make sure you use a locally stored key file in addition \
to the master password. This key file should not be uploaded to the cloud service.<br><br>\
\
