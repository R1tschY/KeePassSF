    text: qsTr("On this page you can create a new database where KeePassSF will store your sensitive data.<br><br>\
\
Open the file browser and choose a file name and a directory. You can choose to locate your database in device memory, \
on the SD card or in the Android Storage. If the SD card entry is grey then no SD \
card is inserted or the card is not correctly detected by the System. There should be only one \
formatted partition on the SD card. Currently multi-partition SD cards are not supported by KeePassSF. \
\"Android storage\" is there to share the database with Android Apps. \
However sharing files with the Android world can be annoying due to different file ownership and permissions. \
Please be aware of that.<br><br>\
\
Advice: If you upload your Keepass database into the cloud please make sure you use a locally stored key file in addition \
to the master password. This key file should not be uploaded to the cloud service.<br><br>\
\
<b>Use key file</b><br><br>\
\
A key file can be used additionally to a master password to protect the Keepass database. Both are used together to \
generate a pass key which will open the database. So by using a file with lots of data inside the generated pass key \
becomes in principle stronger against attacks. You can use for example a random picture as key file.<br><br>\
\
<b>Master password</b><br><br>\
\
Here goes the password for your new Keepass database. Please make sure you choose a long password of around 10 - 15 \
characters and use a mixture of small and big letters, numbers and special characters. Repeat the password in the \
\"Confirm Password\" field.<br><br>")
